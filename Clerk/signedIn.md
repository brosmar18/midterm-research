# `<SignedIn>` Component by Clerk.

## Overview

The `<SignedIn>` component in Next.js provided by Clerk, is used to conditionally render content for authenticated users. It works in tandem with the Clerk authentication system to display specific elements only when a user is signed in.

## Syntax

```js
<SignedIn>{/* Content for signed-in users */}</SignedIn>
```

OR

```js
<SignedIn />
```

## Example

```js
// components/Header.tsx
import { SignedIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";


const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
      </SignedIn>
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;
```
### Breakdown
- The `<SignedIn>` wraps the `<UserButton>` which is only shown to logged-in users. 

## Example
```js
// app/(auth)/signed-in/[[...signed-in]]/page.tsx
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
}

```

### Breakdown 
- This is a page component in a Next.js app using dynamic routing with optional catch-all segments. 
- The component imports and renders the `<SignedIn>` component from Clerk, which provides a user interface for signing in. 

## Summary
The `<SignedIn>` component from Clerk is a powerful tool in Next.js apps for creating user-specific experiences. It allows developers to conditionally render parts of the app based on the user's authentication status, enhancing both security and user experience. The component is versatile and can be used in various parts of an app, from headers to specific pages, to tailor content for authenticated users.
