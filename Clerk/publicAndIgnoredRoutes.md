# `publicRoutes` and `ignoredRotues` in Clerk's `middleware.ts` File. 

## Overview
Clerk's middleware in a Next.js application is used to manage authentication across different routes. It determines which routes require user authentication and which do not.

## `publicRotues`

Routes that are accessible to all users, regardless of authentication status. These routes do not require the user to be logged in. 

### Syntax
```js
publicRoutes: [
    '/path1', 
    '/path2',
    // more routes
]
```

### Example
```js
publicRoutes: [
    '/', 
    '/api/stripe',
]

```
### Breakdown
- `'/'`: The root path of the app is accessible to everyone. 
- `'/api/stripe'`: This API route is accessible without authentication. 

## `ignoredRoutes`

Routes that the Clerk middleware should completely ignore, meaning these routes will neither enforce authentication nor provide user context. 

### Syntax
```js
ignoredRoutes: [
    '/path1', 
    '/path2',
    // more routes
]
```

## Example: 
```js
ignoredRoutes: [
    '/api/clerk',
    '/api/stripe',
]

```
### Breakdown 
- These routes are not only public but also ignored by Clerk's middleware. This is typically useful for routes that handle external services or other processes that do not require user context. 


## Summary 

In a Next.js application using Clerk for authentication, `publicRoutes` and `ignoredRoutes` in the middleware.ts file play crucial roles. `publicRoutes` define paths accessible without authentication, while `ignoredRoutes` are paths that Clerk's middleware should entirely ignore. This setup allows for flexible and secure route management in web applications.
